Link to the 1st launch live site can be found [here](https://torfs-gallery.netlify.app/).

## 📜 Description
<b>Torf's Gallery of Art</b> is an online gallery that showcases a collection of artwork created by the (hobby) artist Torfinn Lie that he has been working on since he retired from his last job. Oil painting is a major technique he uses in most of his paintings, in addition to acrylic painting used occasionally. Torfinn is inspired by his homeland's maritime- and nature landscapes, which is reflected in many of his art. This website will serve as his personal art portfolio where he hopes he can come into contact with other art enthusiasts.

## 🔧 Built With
I used these following tech stack to build this project:
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

## ✎ Update information 
Although this project was graded in advance before submission of Portfolio assignment, I have only been able to make small adjustments based on feedback I received on this exam where I have so far managed to (mentioned changes are located in the ``master`` branch): 
+ Move the common folder into the components folder.
+ Edit the Login.js file so it's not displayed as inline API link (an omission that occurred before submission).
